# Prompts Directory

This directory contains organized prompts for development, AI assistance, and feature implementation.

## üìÅ Structure

- **`README.md`** - This overview file
- **`development.md`** - Development workflow and coding prompts
- **`features.md`** - Feature request and implementation prompts
- **`examples.md`** - Example prompts for common tasks

## üéØ Purpose

These prompts are designed to help with:

- **Cursor AI Development** - Optimized prompts for AI-assisted coding
- **Feature Implementation** - Structured prompts for building new features
- **Code Generation** - Templates for common development patterns
- **Documentation** - Prompts for creating comprehensive docs

## üöÄ Usage

### Bootstrapping

High Level App Idea - 1-2 sentence description on the application

Requirements/Features:
- User can... statements

UX Design
- descriptions on the UX design
- Simplisitic, intentional color usage

Tech Stack:
- Any specific tech requirements
- Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind, Radix UI
- Backend: Next.js API Routes, SQLite, Redis, 
- Tools: Eslint, Prettier, Typescript, Husky, 

Notes:
- Create a plan with phases for each feature/requirement to review before starting
- Plan should have high level class/component relationships defined for code organization. Includes things like app state management across components
- Plan should also include any new libraries/tools we are adding
- Ask me any questions before starting
- Add tests for each feature/requirement
- Execute phases sequentially, pausing to allow me to manually verify and provide feedback
- Check off completed tasks and features in the plan

### For Specific Feature Development

Use these prompts as templates when:

- Building new components
- Creating API routes
- Setting up database operations
- Implementing authentication
- Writing tests

### For Team Collaboration

Share these prompts with team members to ensure consistent development practices and AI assistance patterns.

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Be Specific** - Include context about your project structure and requirements
2. **Include Examples** - Provide code examples when possible
3. **Update Regularly** - Keep prompts current with your project's evolution
4. **Test Prompts** - Verify that prompts produce the expected results
5. **Document Changes** - Note when prompts are updated or deprecated

## üîÑ Maintenance

- Review prompts monthly for accuracy
- Update prompts when project structure changes
- Add new prompts as you discover useful patterns
- Remove outdated or ineffective prompts
